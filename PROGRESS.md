## Technical Implementation Details

### Recently Implemented

- **Real-Time Transcription View**
  ```typescript
  // TranscriptionView component for real-time feedback
  export default function TranscriptionView({
    transcriptions,
    isRecording,
    maxItems = 5
  }: TranscriptionViewProps) {
    // Auto-scroll to the bottom when new transcriptions come in
    useEffect(() => {
      if (containerRef.current) {
        containerRef.current.scrollTop = containerRef.current.scrollHeight;
      }
    }, [transcriptions]);
    
    // Display recent transcriptions with animations
    return (
      <div className="space-y-3">
        <AnimatePresence>
          {recentTranscriptions.map((item) => (
            <motion.div
              key={item.id}
              initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
              animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
              exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
              transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
              className="bg-white p-3 rounded shadow-sm"
            >
              {/* Transcription content */}
            </motion.div>
          ))}
        </AnimatePresence>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

- **Enhanced API Error Handling**
  ```typescript
  // API hook for better error handling
  export function useApiPost<T = any, D = any>(
    url: string,
    options: RequestInit = {}
  ): ApiResponse<T> & { 
    executePost: (data: D, additionalOptions?: RequestInit) => Promise<T | null> 
  } {
    const api = useApi<T>(url, {
      method: 'POST',
      ...options,
    });

    // Enhanced execute function that accepts data as first parameter
    const executePost = useCallback(
      async (data: D, additionalOptions: RequestInit = {}) => {
        return api.execute({
          ...additionalOptions,
          body: JSON.stringify(data),
        });
      },
      [api]
    );

    return { ...api, executePost };
  }
  ```

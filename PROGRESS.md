   - Large context windows may cause performance issues on older hardware
   - *Priority: Medium - Optimization ongoing*

2. **Visual Content Processing**
   - OCR integration is still in development
   - Screen content analysis is not yet fully implemented
   - *Priority: High - Active development*

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - Continuous processing can use significant CPU/memory on lower-end devices
   - Local LLM integration increases minimum system requirements
   - *Priority: Low - Optimization planned for Phase 3*

## Technical Implementation Details

### Currently Implemented

- **Audio Transcription API Integration**
  ```typescript
  // Transcription stream implementation
  pipe.streamTranscriptions(async (transcription) => {
    // Add timestamp and unique ID
    const enrichedTranscription = {
      ...transcription,
      id: uuidv4(),
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    
    // Add to state
    meetingState.transcriptions.push(enrichedTranscription);
    
    // Update notes
    await updateNotes(meetingState, pipe);
  });
  ```

- **UI Components**
  ```typescript
  // Main notes view route
  routes: {
    "/": {
      component: "NotesView",
      props: { meetingState }
    },
    "/config": {
      component: "ConfigPanel",
      props: { /* configuration options */ }
    }
  }
  ```

### In Progress Implementation

- **OCR Processing**
  ```typescript
  // Currently in development
  pipe.streamVision(async (frame) => {
    const ocrResult = await extractTextFromFrame(frame, pipe);
    await processVisualContent(frame, meetingState, pipe);
  });
  ```

- **LLM Context Preparation**
  ```typescript
  // In development
  const context = {
    recentTranscriptions: latestContent.transcriptions,
    recentVisualContent: latestContent.visualContent,
    currentNotes: state.notes
  };
  ```

## Next Steps

1. Obtain OpenAI API key for LLM integration
2. Complete the visual content integration component
3. Finalize LLM integration for notes processing
4. Implement basic export functionality
5. Design and implement the meeting database schema
6. Conduct internal testing with varied meeting scenarios
7. Optimize performance for longer meetings (1hr+)
8. Prepare for Phase 2 development
